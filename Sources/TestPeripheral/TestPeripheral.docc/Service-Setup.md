## Overview

This guides provides an overview on how to deploy the test peripheral as a launchd launch agent on macOS.

> Tip: For more information on `launchd` refer to the [Creating Launch Daemons and Agents](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html)
    guide or other resources like [What is launchd?](https://launchd.info).

### Build the TestPeripheral

1. Clone the repository and open it in Xcode.
2. Select the `TestPeripheral` scheme and `Any Mac` as the destination.
3. Run `Product > Archive` to build and archive a release build.
4. Open the Xcode Organizer and distribute the build products of the archive from the previous step.
5. Move the `TestPeripheral` binary into the `/Applications` folder. 


> Important: Make sure to run the TestPeripheral manually once.
    You might need to navigate to `Settings > Privacy & Security` to allow TestPeripheral to bypass your notarization settings.

### Setup as a Service

We provide a small script to run the test peripheral as a service using `launchd` on macOS.#
Follow the following steps to install and run the service.
We assume that you placed the `TestPeripheral` binary in the `/Applications` folder as per the previous steps.

#### Install Service

To install the launchd service run the following command in the root folder of the SpeziBluetooth project:

```
./bin/service-launchd.sh install
```

#### Start Service

To load the service into launchd run the following command:

```
./bin/service-launchd.sh start
```

>Tip: If the peripheral doesn't show up, toggle Bluetooth off and on again as a troubleshooting step.

#### Stop Service

To unload the service from launchd run the following command:

```
./bin/service-launchd.sh stop
```

#### Status

You can get the current status of the launch agent using the following command:
```
./bin/service-launchd.sh status
```

If the service is running, you will get output similar to the one below.
The first column is the PID of the application (or `-` if not running) and the second column is the last exit code.

```
Started:
9314    0       edu.stanford.spezi.bluetooth.testperipheralÂ´
```

#### Uninstall Service

To completely uninstall the launchd launch agent, run the following command:

```
./bin/service-launchd.sh uninstall
```


### UI Test Setup

When trying to run SpeziBluetooth UI tests on a macOS runner with the test peripheral running nearby,
there are a few things to consider:

1. You need to setup signing for the TestApp.
2. Run the UI tests manually once (or observe the first run) to a) allow UI automation testing and b) allow Bluetooth access for the TestApp.
3. Disable anything interfering with the runner (e.g., disabling screen saver).
